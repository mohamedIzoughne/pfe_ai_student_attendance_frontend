- so now what should we do:

in admin dashboard:

<!-- - - - show something besides students page when no student. the same thing with teachers -->
<!-- - - - add images for el mehdi, abdelmoula -->
<!-- - - - sidebar buttons coloring(should work when we have params) -->
<!-- - - - add data for el mehdi, abdelmoula especially marks and image -->
<!-- - - - attendance rate for students -->
<!-- - - - make better names for sessions of teachers -->
<!-- - - - fix images for teachers -->
<!-- - - - courses page, description when adding/editing a course + field id -->
<!-- - - - search functionality in courses page -->

in teacher dashboard:

<!-- - - - I don't know why total subjects = 0 -->
<!-- - - - I think last complaints don't work correctly -->
<!-- - - - course attendance, we should have filtering by weeks: this is in admin dashboard and in teacher dashboard -->
<!-- - - - we want only courses for teacher not all the courses -->
<!-- - - - in sessions in mark attendance page, we have some duplication of session names -->
- - - mark attendance experiment

- - - remove debouncing in some places to have better ux
- - - we want unique session names because when selecting session we see so many with the same name which is not what we want

- - you should understand what those averages numbers mean exactly. teachers might ask you about this

-- there are so many problems, for example we should not allow adding complaints of a session that exist for another course. should be fixed later

- - you shouldn't add a complaint for attendance that doesn't exist, you shouldn't have marks for exams that haven't passed yet
