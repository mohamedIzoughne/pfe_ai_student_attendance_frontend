- so now what should we do:


in admin dashboard:
<!-- - - - show something besides students page when no student. the same thing with teachers -->
<!-- - - - add images for el mehdi, abdelmoula -->
<!-- - - - sidebar buttons coloring(should work when we have params) -->
<!-- - - - add data for el mehdi, abdelmoula especially marks and image -->
<!-- - - - attendance rate for students -->
<!-- - - - make better names for sessions of teachers -->
<!-- - - - fix images for teachers -->
<!-- - - - courses page, description when adding/editing a course + field id -->
<!-- - - - search functionality in courses page -->

in teacher dashboard:

- - - I don't know why total subjects = 0
- - - course attendance, we should have filtering by weeks: this is in admin dashboard and in teacher dashboard
- - - we want only courses for teacher not all the courses
- - - in sessions in mark attendance page, we have some duplication of session names
- - - in marking attendance: are you sure about that 100%, I feel like it always gives it
- - - mark attendance fix all, add experiments
